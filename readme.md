# PhilCraft

A Minecraft-inspired voxel game built with Python, OpenGL, and Pygame. Explore, build, and modify a procedurally generated world with block-based building mechanics.

## Features

- **3D Voxel World**: Fully rendered 3D world with chunked terrain generation
- **Multiple View Modes**: Switch between first-person and third-person perspectives
- **Block Building**: Place and remove blocks with realistic physics
- **Player Physics**: Gravity, collision detection, and smooth movement
- **Optimized Rendering**: Efficient chunk-based rendering with face culling
- **Creative Flight**: Toggle between walking and flying modes
- **Crosshair Targeting**: Visual targeting system for precise block placement

## Requirements

### Dependencies

```
pygame
numpy
PyOpenGL
PyOpenGL_accelerate (optional, for better performance)
```

### System Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- OpenGL 2.1 compatible graphics card
- At least 2GB RAM
- Windows, macOS, or Linux

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repository-url>
   cd philcraft
   ```

2. **Install required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install pygame numpy PyOpenGL PyOpenGL_accelerate
   ```

3. **Run the game:**
   ```bash
   python minecraft11.py
   ```

## Controls

| Key/Action | Function |
|------------|----------|
| **WASD** | Move around (forward/left/backward/right) |
| **Mouse** | Look around (camera rotation) |
| **Space** | Move up / Jump |
| **Shift** | Move down / Sneak |
| **Left Click** | Remove block |
| **Right Click** | Place block |
| **F** | Cycle view modes (First Person ‚Üí Third Person Back ‚Üí Third Person Front) |
| **G** | Toggle game mode (Walking/Flying) |
| **R** | Reset camera position |
| **ESC** | Exit game |

## Game Modes

### Walking Mode
- Realistic gravity and physics
- Jump mechanics with Space key
- Collision detection with terrain

### Flying Mode
- Free movement in all directions
- No gravity effects
- Perfect for building and exploration

## View Modes

1. **First Person**: Traditional Minecraft-style first-person view
2. **Third Person Back**: Camera positioned behind the player
3. **Third Person Front**: Camera positioned in front of the player

## Block Types

The game currently supports several block types:

- **Grass** (Green): Basic terrain block
- **Stone** (Gray): Solid building material
- **Leaves** (Dark Green): Tree foliage
- **Wood** (Brown): Tree trunks and building material

## Technical Features

### Chunk System
- World divided into 16x16 block chunks
- Dynamic chunk loading and unloading
- Optimized rendering of visible chunks only

### Collision Detection
- Precise AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) collision
- Prevents placing blocks inside the player
- Smooth collision response

### Raycast System
- Accurate block targeting up to 5 blocks away
- Face-aware block placement
- Precise hit detection for block removal

### Performance Optimizations
- Face culling for hidden block faces
- Chunk-based rendering
- Distance-based rendering limits
- Efficient OpenGL usage

## Development

### Adding New Block Types

To add new block types, modify the `colors` dictionary in `MinecraftGame.__init__()`:

```python
self.colors = {
    1: (0.2, 0.8, 0.2),  # Grass green
    2: (0.1, 0.6, 0.1),  # Dark green (leaves)
    3: (0.6, 0.6, 0.6),  # Stone gray
    4: (0.4, 0.2, 0.1),  # Brown (tree trunk)
    5: (1.0, 1.0, 0.0),  # Your new block (yellow)
}
```

### Modifying World Generation

World generation logic is handled in `world.py`. You can modify the `generate_terrain()` method to create different landscape features.

### Performance Tuning

Key performance settings can be adjusted in the respective files:
- Render distance: `world.py`
- Chunk size: `mcchunk.py`
- Target FPS: `minecraft11.py` (clock.tick value)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Game won't start / OpenGL errors:**
- Ensure your graphics drivers are up to date
- Verify OpenGL 2.1+ support on your system
- Try installing PyOpenGL_accelerate for better performance

**Low FPS:**
- Reduce render distance in world settings
- Close other applications to free up system resources
- Consider reducing chunk generation complexity

**Controls not responding:**
- Make sure the game window has focus
- Check that mouse capture is working (cursor should be hidden)
- Try pressing ESC to exit and restart

### Debug Information

The game prints debug information to the console including:
- FPS (Frames Per Second)
- Number of chunks rendered
- Total blocks in view
- Camera position
